I am Ziyue Qiu (邱子悦 in Chinese), a first-year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Greg Ganger](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/) and [George Amvrosiadis](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~gamvrosi/). I am interested in storage systems, operating systems and other system issues.

Previously, I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Cheng Li](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~chengli7/) at USTC, Prof. [Xiaosong Ma](https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/staff/dr-xiaosong-ma) at Qatar Computing Research Institute & HKBU, Dr. [Qi Chen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cheqi/), Dr. [Mao Yang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/maoyang/) at MSR-Asia.

[Liwei Luo @ UCI](https://loliw.moe/) is a CS student who loves daydreaming :). I have to mention that I really enjoy discussing Feminism with her!

[Ruomin Huang @ USTC](https://fockee.github.io/) is an elegant researcher, and I am pretty sure he would agree with this statement :) Good luck to him on 2023 Fall applications.

[Beining Wu @ USTC](https://beiningwu7.github.io/) is a hard-working researcher. Good luck to him on 2023 Fall applications.

[Zhanghan Wang @ NYU](https://rabbitwhite1.github.io/) is a system PhD with Girlfriend and Happiness. So good :(

[Zihan Zheng](https://zhengzihan.com/) works on security and he knows many things. Not just because he is older than me :)

[Wei Fan @ Upenn](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~luke2001/) is a Statistics PhD who hopes people can [push his friends](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~luke2001/push.html) (e.g. me).

[Bowen Li @ CMU](https://jaraxxus-me.github.io/) is a Robotics PhD with many papers, too many compared with System PhD :(

[Yiwei Yuan @ USTC](https://yyw.moe/) is a totoro (joking) and he believes he is a research Trash (definitely not!)

[Zhengyang Geng @ CMU](https://gsunshine.github.io/) is a warm person to be friends with (especially when he prevents me from becoming last place in Dominion games by becoming the last one himself), and I have to mention that he has a wife (! happy family)

[Alec Sun @ CMU](https://sites.google.com/view/alecsun/home) plays 'frisbee' so well and believes himself a better frisbee teacher than me! And he keeps correcting my English speaking and writing (including this page), so sweet :) Hope his Mandarin will improve with me around.

[Keyu Tao @ USTC](https://www.taoky.moe/) is a great CS person and enjoys anime as well. Although [he doesn't like self-introduction](https://blog.taoky.moe/about/), I do this for him :) I am such an angel!!

[Mingkuan Xu @ CMU](https://mingkuan.taichi.graphics/) is so good at board games that we all dream to win him once :( BTW, I really enjoy discussing finance questions with him.

[Yihang Yao @ CMU](https://sites.google.com/view/yaoyiyao/) is such a great Mechanical Engineering student w/o publication (just kidding) like me :(

[Kaiyang Zhao @ CMU](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kaiyang2/) is a systems PhD (!) who prefers to stay alone in some time (most time maybe), so we sometimes just run away from a social event together :)

[Wenzhuo Xu @ CMU](https://wenzhuo.webflow.io/) is able to gain high scores in Toefl (118/30 in speaking) and other exams but don't know how to 'gain' his first publication till now (just joking, he is great like Yihang).

[Shu (Lynn) Liu @ UC Berkeley](https://lynnliu030.github.io/) is a [hobbyist photographer](https://lynnliu030.github.io/photography/) and a Systems PhD who has so many things in common with me :) (e.g. research interest and background). Hope we both have a bright future.

[Chi Zhang @ CMU](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chizhang1997/) is a sweet girl with wide interests. For instance, I enjoy playing 飞花令 (a game that needs a solid knowledge of Chinese poems) with her.

[Yewen Fan @ CMU](https://tofuwen.github.io/) is a card-game PhD (joking), enthusiastic about contract bridge, 双升 and other card games, and research (of course!).

[Yue Wu @ CMU](https://www.yuewu.ml/) is not only a researcher successful in RL but also a quality man in various aspects of life (e.g. food, household supplies, playing frisbee).

[Xinshuai Dong @ CMU](https://dongxinshuai.github.io/) is a master at fishing (someone that lets you talk and talk until you have completely exposed yourself) and has a double PhD degree in card games and frisbee (joking!).

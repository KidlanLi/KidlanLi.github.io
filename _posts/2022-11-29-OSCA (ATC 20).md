[OSCA: An Online-Model Based Cache Allocation Scheme in Cloud Block Storage Systems](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc20/presentation/zhang-yu)

## Abstract

略

## Introduction

cloud block storage (CBS)

- Cloud infrastructures typically employ cache servers, consisting of multiple cache instances competing for the same pool of resources.
- The currently used even-allocation policy called **EAP** or equal cache partitioning determines the cache requirements in advance according to the respective <u>subscribed SLOs and then provisions cache resources for each cache instance</u>. However, this static configuration method is often suboptimal for the cloud environment and induces resource wastage, because the cloud I/O workloads are commonly highly-skewed.

Contributions:

- online cache model based on re-access ratio (not collect+process date, but trace unique data blocks)
- total hit traffic as metric to gauge cache efficency
- search optimal configuration using dynamic programming

## Background and Motivation

### Cloud Block Storage

暂略

### Cache Allocation Scheme

- qualitative methods (TCM, REF)
- quantitative methods, using Miss Ratio Curve (MRC) (SHARDS)

### Existing Cache Modeling Methods

- Locality quantization method

RAR-CM 相比 SHARDS 的好处是用更多的空间换时间，注意，两者都可以 online。

- Simulation-based cache modeling: concurrently run multiple simulation instances to determine the cache hit ratio in different cache sizes

## Design and Implementation

### Design Overview

略

### Re-access Ratio Based Cache Model

这块是重点，论文说实话看得我有点乱，引用 slides 里面的例子：

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/fig/OSCA-fig3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

reuse distance 是一个块从上一次被挪到队头，往后移动的实际距离

那么具体如何设计实现呢？

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/fig/OSCA-fig4.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/fig/OSCA-fig5.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

Goal: Overall hit traffic

## Evaluation

略

## 评论

首先是几个问题：

- How to manage reuse records (hash map)?
  - How to refresh start timestamp? How to do aging? (In this paper, once per day refresh or even not)
  - When lots of items being evicted, how long should such records in hash map be kept? How to efficiently/sufficiently clean them?
- How fast is MRC construct? (In this paper, sequential construction)
  - Maybe coarse-grained bucket is enough

本文还缺省了很多 sensitivity analysis，比如：

- DP 的速度
- MRC construction 如何 catch up dynamic workload 的？
- 等等
